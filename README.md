# **Netbeans 8.2 performance tweaks**
My colleagues including myself have had serious performance problems when using Netbeans.
Truth to be told, it is not the Netbeans itself which is a major culprit and to be blamed, however, it does contribute performace degradation.
After a long time, many tests and trilas and failures, finally, I may say that overall performance degradation is gone.
Just to point out, a project we're working on, is an enterprise application, Erp so to speak, which consists of 20 subprojets, with thousands of classes, xmls and other resources.
